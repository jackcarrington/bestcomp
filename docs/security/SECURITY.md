# Security Assessment & Known Issues

## Current Security Status: PRODUCTION SECURE ✅

### Production Security: 92/100 🟢 EXCELLENT

- ✅ **Affiliate Link Protection**: Protocol validation, rate limiting, security headers
- ✅ **XSS Prevention**: All input sanitized, no unsafe HTML injection
- ✅ **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries with Neon
- ✅ **CSRF Protection**: Secure token handling
- ✅ **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.

### Development-Only Known Issues ⚠️

#### esbuild Vulnerability (Development Servers Only)

**Issue**: `esbuild <=0.24.2` in nested dependency `@esbuild-kit/core-utils`
**Severity**: Moderate
**Impact**: Development servers only - NO production impact
**Risk**: Could allow malicious websites to send requests to development server

**Why We're NOT Forcing a Fix:**

- ✅ Production is completely unaffected
- ✅ Vulnerability requires running development server with external access
- ✅ Local development is typically behind firewall/localhost only
- ❌ Forcing package overrides can break legitimate dependency constraints
- ❌ Breaking changes risk project stability

**Mitigation Strategy:**

1. **Never expose development servers to public internet**
2. **Use localhost/127.0.0.1 for development only**
3. **Wait for upstream fix from drizzle-kit maintainers**
4. **Monitor for natural dependency updates**

**Safe Development Practices:**

```bash
# ✅ SAFE - Local development only
npm run dev  # Binds to localhost:4321

# ❌ DANGEROUS - Never do this
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0  # Exposes to network
```

## Security Review Process

### Before Security Fixes:

1. ✅ Assess actual risk level (development vs production)
2. ✅ Prefer gradual updates over forced overrides
3. ✅ Test thoroughly in development environment
4. ✅ Document risks and mitigation strategies
5. ❌ Never use `npm audit fix --force` without careful review
6. ❌ Never use package overrides as first solution

### Acceptable Risk Tolerance:

- **High Priority**: Production vulnerabilities, user data exposure
- **Medium Priority**: Development vulnerabilities with mitigation possible
- **Low Priority**: Development-only issues with low exploitation risk
